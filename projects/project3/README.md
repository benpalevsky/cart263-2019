Proverbial Generation
==============

Proverbs are strange beasts of language. They seem to have a call and answer like cadence. *An apple a day keeps the doctor away. A penny saved is a penny earned.* You can really feel the division (and if you can't, I'm driving this point home anyways)-

A penny saved **deep breath** is a penny earned.
An apple a day **deep breath** keeps the doctor away.

I thought it would be fun to start smooshing random proverbs together. Proverbial generation lets call it. Picture a machine which chooses two random proverbs and then makes a proverb sandwich. Not all the sandwiches would be tasty, but at least you're eating them right?

That's kind of how procedural generation makes me feel sometimes. "Wow I never would have thought to make a banana peel hamburger sandwich but I'm happy I tried it!"

Similarly, I hope you will enjoy sampling these proverbs. *A penny saved keeps the doctor away. The grass is fast. A true friend is many a pang.* Are all great examples of time you will never get back because you spent it reading sentences that seem to have weight and meaning. Oh well!

As it turns out, the **deep breath** part of the proverb kept landing on the verb (third person, singular present) of the phrase. If you use RiTa.js, you can able to deconstruct a phrase into its parts of speech, find out which word is a third person, singular verb, and then take two proverbs, make the incision, and conjoin them!

I'm not really sure why, but I'm both terrified, and in love, with automated/procedurally generated content. I used this project as an attempt to better understand it. And if you want to understand even more, I'd urge you to to read "Something is Wrong on the Internet" by James Bridle. In it, he warns us about the dangers of automated content.

And to him I say: *An elephant never forgets no moss.*

**deep breath** It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay.
