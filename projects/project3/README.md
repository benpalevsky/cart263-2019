Trivia
==============

It's Trivia! It's physics! It's Trivia meets physics!

Fair warning, I didn't finish this project in time. The scope got away from me. I'm going to submit what I have now, and spend a bit of time cleaning up my code. I'm pleased with my work, but this was much harder to do than I thought. I'll talk about three things in this artist's statement.

  1. My intentions for the project
  2. What I spent my time on
  3. What I didn't get to.

So this project, in design, was supposed to be a game in which you have to play physics games to answer trivia questions. Like shooting a slingshot at a target, or dropping a pachinko ball into the right basket.

In implementation, I unfortunately never got there. I spent a lot of time on managing different states of the application, learning and experimenting with matter.js, and just managing a lot of moving parts. As of this commit, I'm actually a lot closer to making the mini-games. It just took me so long to get a core loop into place.

So about that core loop- basically it makes a call to a Trivia API, makes a call to a randomPaletteGenerator API, asks you a trivia question, loads up matter.js, you move around all physics'y and stuff, and then you submit your answer. The overall experience is not that great. I give it a C+, and that's being generous.

That said, doing the work was great. Sure my project didn't come together the way I wanted it to, but I feel that if I keep working on this, I could get there. It would take me two more days, I think. Although that's probably wrong. Project scope is difficult (this is one of my main takeaways).

Hopefully the code isn't too painful to read. I'm pleased with how it turned out.
