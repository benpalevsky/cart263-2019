Sisyphus is Happy

Happiness is Sisyphus? Maybe. The statement is bold, thought provoking, and edgy. Let's unpack it a bit.

My theory: In doing *something*, over and over again, we get better at *the thing*. Getting better at *the thing* seems to make people mysteriously happy. What doesn't make people happy is abstract, general claims, so lets conjure an example.

An example: You do some math problems. You're unhappy. You do some more math problems. You're still unhappy. Now you develop general artificial intelligence and you're the most revered coder in the world. You're unhappy- BUT only because your AI is threatening to destroy humanity! Before that though, there was a moment of pure happiness. You solved the worlds toughest problem! Creating a general form of intelligence basically means that you're a god of some sorts. And you did, for a moment, push a boulder to the top of a hill. Bet you're thankful you did those math problems now!

However, there's an important quality to the work that Sisyphus does. I think that quality is monotony. I'll explain, again by example. Jankovics Marcell animated an absolutely stunning film of Sissy-fists pushing a boulder up a hill. The thing is, the boulder keeps getting bigger and bigger. And because the boulder keeps getting bigger, Sisterflips needs to work harder and harder to push it to the top of the hill. There is no monotony here, because apparent challenge keeps increasing as Sis' skill, or strength, increases.

In other portrayals, Sisyphus pushes boulders up and down all day with little challenge, or increase in difficulty over time. I think this is missing the point of the myth. Shout-out to Wikipedia for this definition, "Tasks that are both laborious and futile are therefore described as Sisyphean" I really do think that the key to happiness is the labor, and not the futility. So is happiness Sisyphus? I think it is. But is Sisyphus happy?

I hope so! Nobody seems to care about the man in the myth! We only observe the myth itself. But how about some empathy for this probably fictional character? To explore this dumb idea, I made a Sisyphus mood board. Because we already know that happiness is Sisyphus, I think we should start figuring out if Sisyphus is happy. Pre-loaded with stock sentences and emojis, this millennial x ancient greek mashup will leave you thinking, "wow, I've just wasted some time" ... "but atleast it's better than pushing a boulder up a hill".

Except it's not. Or is it?
